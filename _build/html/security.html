<div class="section" id="container-security-paradigms">
<h2>Container security paradigms<a class="headerlink" href="#container-security-paradigms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First some background. Most container platforms operate on the
premise, <strong>trusted users running trusted containers</strong>. This means that
the primary UNIX account controlling the container platform is either
“root” or user(s) that root has deputized (either via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code> or given access
to a control socket of a root owned daemon process).
Singularity on the other hand, operates on a different premise because
it was developed for HPC type infrastructures where you have users,
none of which are considered trusted. This means the paradigm is
considerably different as we must support <strong>untrusted users running
untrusted containers</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="untrusted-users-running-untrusted-containers">
<h2>Untrusted users running untrusted containers!<a class="headerlink" href="#untrusted-users-running-untrusted-containers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This simple phrase describes the security perspective Singularity is
designed with. And if you additionally consider the fact that running
containers at all typically requires some level of privilege
escalation, means that attention to security is of the utmost
importance.</p>
<div class="section" id="privilege-escalation-is-necessary-for-containerization">
<h3>Privilege escalation is necessary for containerization!<a class="headerlink" href="#privilege-escalation-is-necessary-for-containerization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned, there are several containerization system calls and
functions which are considered “privileged” in that they must be
executed with a certain level of capability/privilege. To do this, all
container systems must employ one of the following mechanisms:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Limit usage to root:</strong> Only allow the root user (or users granted <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code>)
to run containers. This has the obvious limitation of not allowing
arbitrary users the ability to run containers, nor does it allow
users to run containers as themselves. Access to data, security data,
and securing systems becomes difficult and perhaps impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Root owned daemon process:</strong> Some container systems use a root
owned daemon background process which manages the containers and
spawns the jobs within the container. Implementations of this
typically have an IPC control socket for communicating with this root
owned daemon process and if you wish to allow trusted users to
control the daemon, you must give them access to the control socket.
This is the Docker model.</li>
<li><strong>SetUID:</strong> Set UID is the “old school” UNIX method for running a
particular program with escalated permission. While it is widely used
due to it’s legacy and POSIX requirement, it lacks the ability to
manage fine grained control of what a process can and can not do; a
SetUID root program runs as root with all capabilities that comes
with root. For this reason, SetUID programs are traditional targets
for hackers.</li>
<li><strong>User Namespace:</strong> The Linux kernel’s user namespace may allow a
user to virtually become another user and run a limited set
privileged system functions. Here the privilege escalation is managed
via the Linux kernel which takes the onus off of the program. This is
a new kernel feature and thus requires new kernels and not all
distributions have equally adopted this technology.</li>
<li><strong>Capability Sets:</strong> Linux handles permissions, access, and roles via
capability sets. The root user has these capabilities automatically
activated while non-privileged users typically do not have these
capabilities enabled. You can enable and disable capabilities on a
per process and per file basis (if allowed to do so).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-singularity-do-it">
<h3>How does Singularity do it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-singularity-do-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Singularity must allow users to run containers as themselves which rules
out options 1 and 2 from the above list. Singularity supports the rest
of the options to following degrees of functionally:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>User Namespace:</strong> Singularity supports the user namespace natively
and can run completely unprivileged (“rootless”) since version 2.2
(October 2016) but features are severely limited. You will not be
able to use container “images” and will be forced to only work with
directory (sandbox) based containers. Additionally, as mentioned, the
user namespace is not equally supported on all distribution kernels
so don’t count on legacy system support and usability may vary.</li>
<li><strong>SetUID:</strong> This is the default usage model for Singularity because
it gives the most flexibility in terms of supported features and
legacy compliance. It is also the most risky from a security
perspective. For that reason, Singularity has been developed with
transparency in mind. The code is written with attention to
simplicity and readability and Singularity increases the effective
permission set only when it is necessary, and drops it immediately
(as can be seen with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">–debug</span></code> run flag). There have been several
independent audits of the source code, and while they are not
definitive, it is a good assurance.</li>
<li><strong>Capability Sets:</strong> This is where Singularity is headed as an
alternative to SetUID because it allows for much finer grained
capability control and will support all of Singularity’s features.
The downside is that it is not supported equally on shared file
systems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-are-the-singularity-priviledged-components">
<h2>Where are the Singularity priviledged components<a class="headerlink" href="#where-are-the-singularity-priviledged-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you install Singularity as root, it will automatically setup the
necessary files as SetUID (as of version 2.4, this is the default run
mode). The location of these files is dependent on how Singularity was
installed and the options passed to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configure</span></code> script. Assuming a default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./configure</span></code> run
which installs files into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--prefix</span></code> of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></code> you can find the SetUID programs as
follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ find /usr/local/libexec/singularity/ -perm -4000

/usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/start-suid

/usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/action-suid

/usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/mount-suid
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each of the binaries is named accordingly to the action that it is
suited for, and generally, each handles the required privilege
escalation necessary for Singularity to operate. What specifically
requires escalated privileges?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Mounting (and looping) the Singularity container image</li>
<li>Creation of the necessary namespaces in the kernel</li>
<li>Binding host paths into the container</li>
</ol>
<p>Removing any of these SUID binaries or changing the permissions on them
would cause Singularity to utilize the non-SUID workflows. Each file
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*-suid</span></code> also has a non-suid equivalent:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/start

/usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/action

/usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/mount
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While most of these workflows will not properly function without the
SUID components, we have provided these fall back executables for
sites that wish to limit the SETUID capabilities to the bare
essentials/minimum. To disable the SetUID portions of Singularity, you
can either remove the above <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*-suid</span></code> files, or you can edit the setting for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allow</span> <span class="pre">suid</span></code> at
the top of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">singularity.conf</span></code> file, which is typically located in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PREFIX/etc/singularity/singularity.conf</span></code>.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># ALLOW SETUID: [BOOL]

# DEFAULT: yes

# Should we allow users to utilize the setuid program flow within Singularity?

# note1: This is the default mode, and to utilize all features, this option

# will need to be enabled.

# note2: If this option is disabled, it will rely on the user namespace

# exclusively which has not been integrated equally between the different

# Linux distributions.

allow setuid = yes
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can also install Singularity as root without any of the SetUID
components with the configure option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--disable-suid</span></code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./configure --disable-suid --prefix=/usr/local

$ make

$ sudo make install

<h2>Can I install Singularity as a user?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-install-singularity-as-a-user" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, but don’t expect all of the functions to work. If the SetUID
components are not present, Singularity will attempt to use the “user
namespace”. Even if the kernel you are using supports this namespace
fully, you will still not be able to access all of the Singularity
features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="container-permissions-and-usage-strategy">
<h2>Container permissions and usage strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#container-permissions-and-usage-strategy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a system admin, you want to set up a configuration that is
customized for your cluster or shared resource. In the following
paragraphs, we will elaborate on this container permissions strategy,
giving detail about which users are allowed to run containers, along
with image curation and ownership.</p>
<p>These settings can all be found in the Singularity configuration file
which is installed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PREFIX/etc/singularity/singularity.conf</span></code>. When running in a privileged mode, the
configuration file <strong>MUST</strong> be owned by root and thus the system
administrator always has the final control.</p>
<div class="section" id="controlling-what-kind-of-containers-are-allowed">
<h3>controlling what kind of containers are allowed<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-what-kind-of-containers-are-allowed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Singularity supports several different container formats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>squashfs:</strong> Compressed immutable (read only) container images
(default in version 2.4)</li>
<li><strong>extfs:</strong> Raw file system writable container images</li>
<li><strong>dir:</strong> Sandbox containers (chroot style directories)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Singularity configuration file, you can control what types of
containers Singularity will support:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># ALLOW CONTAINER ${TYPE}: [BOOL]

# DEFAULT: yes

# This feature limits what kind of containers that Singularity will allow

# users to use (note this does not apply for root).

allow container squashfs = yes

allow container extfs = yes

allow container dir = yes
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limiting-usage-to-specific-container-file-owners">
<h3>limiting usage to specific container file owners<a class="headerlink" href="#limiting-usage-to-specific-container-file-owners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One benefit of using container images is that they exist on the
filesystem as any other file would. This means that POSIX permissions
are mandatory. Here you can configure Singularity to only “trust”
containers that are owned by a particular set of users.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># LIMIT CONTAINER OWNERS: [STRING]

# DEFAULT: NULL

# Only allow containers to be used that are owned by a given user. If this

# configuration is undefined (commented or set to NULL), all containers are

# allowed to be used. This feature only applies when Singularity is running in

# SUID mode and the user is non-root.

#limit container owners = gmk, singularity, nobody
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you are in a high risk security environment, you may want to
enable this feature. Trusting container images to users could allow a
malicious user to modify an image either before or while being used and
cause unexpected behavior from the kernel (e.g. a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DOS

<h3>limiting usage to specific paths<a class="headerlink" href="#limiting-usage-to-specific-paths" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The configuration file also gives you the ability to limit containers to
specific paths. This is very useful to ensure that only trusted or
blessed container’s are being used (it is also beneficial to ensure that
containers are only being used on performant file systems).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># LIMIT CONTAINER PATHS: [STRING]

<div class="section" id="logging">
<h2>Logging<a class="headerlink" href="#logging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Singularity offers a very comprehensive auditing mechanism via the
system log. For each command that is issued, it prints the UID, PID, and
location of the command. For example, let’s see what happens if we shell
into an image:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ singularity exec ubuntu true

$ singularity shell --home $HOME:/ ubuntu

forgot about) previously set, I can trace the entire flow of Singularity
from the first execution of an action (shell) to the final shell into
the container. Each line also describes what is the effective UID
running the command, what is the PID, and what is the function emitting
the debug message.</p>

never escalated, but we have the same outcome using a sandbox directory

<p>Here you can see that the output and functionality is very similar,
but we never increased any privilege and none of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*-suid</span></code> program flow was
utilized. We had to use a chroot style directory container (as images
are not supported with the user namespace, but you can clearly see
that the effective UID never had to change to run this container.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Singularity supports multiple modes of operation to meet your security
needs. For most HPC centers, and general usage scenarios, the default
run mode is most effective and featurefull. For the security critical
implementations, the user namespace workflow maybe a better option. It
becomes a balance security and functionality (the most secure systems do
nothing).</p>
