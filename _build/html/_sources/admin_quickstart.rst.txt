Administration QuickStart
=========================

This document will cover installation and administration points of
Singularity for multi-tenant HPC resources and will not cover usage of
the command line tools, container usage, or example use cases.

------------
Installation
------------

There are two common ways to install Singularity, from source code and
via binary packages. This document will explain the process of
installation from source, and it will depend on your build host to have
the appropriate development tools and packages installed. For Red Hat
and derivatives, you should install the following ``yum`` group to ensure you
have an appropriately setup build server:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

Downloading the source
======================

You can download the source code either from the latest stable tarball
release or via the GitHub master repository. Here is an example
downloading and preparing the latest development code from GitHub:

.. code-block:: none

    $ mkdir ~/git

    $ cd ~/git

    $ git clone https://github.com/sylabs/singularity.git

    $ cd singularity

    $ ./autogen.sh

Once you have downloaded the source, the following installation
procedures will assume you are running from the root of the source
directory.

Source Installation
===================

The following example demonstrates how to install Singularity into ``/usr/local``.
You can install Singularity into any directory of your choosing, but
you must ensure that the location you select supports programs running
as ``SUID``. It is common for people to disable ``SUID`` with the mount option ``nosuid`` for
various network mounted file systems. To ensure proper support, it is
easiest to make sure you install Singularity to a local file system.

Assuming that ``/usr/local`` is a local file system:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc

    $ make

    $ sudo make install


.. note:: **The** ``make install`` **above must be run as root to have Singularity properly
    installed. Failure to install as root will cause Singularity to not
    function properly or have limited functionality when run by a non-root
    user.**

Also note that when you configure, ``squashfs-tools`` is **not** required, however it is
required for full functionality. You will see this message after the
configuration:

.. code-block:: none

    mksquashfs from squash-tools is required for full functionality

If you choose not to install ``squashfs-tools``, you will hit an error when your users try
a pull from Docker Hub, for example.

Prefix in special places (--localstatedir)
==========================================

As with most autotools-based build scripts, you are able to supply the ``--prefix``
argument to the configure script to change where Singularity will be
installed. Care must be taken when this path is not a local filesystem
or has atypical permissions. The local state directories used by
Singularity at runtime will also be placed under the supplied ``--prefix`` and this
will cause malfunction if the tree is read-only. You may also
experience issues if this directory is shared between several
hosts/nodes that might run Singularity simultaneously.

In such cases, you should specify the ``--localstatedir`` variable in addition to ``--prefix``. This
will override the prefix, instead placing the local state directories
within the path explicitly provided. Ideally this should be within the
local filesystem, specific to only a single host or node.
For example, the Makefile contains this variable by default:

.. code-block:: none

    CONTAINER_OVERLAY = ${prefix}/var/singularity/mnt/overlay

By supplying the configure argument ``--localstatedir=/some/other/place`` Singularity will instead be built
with the following. Note that ``${prefix}/var`` that has been replaced by the supplied
value:

.. code-block:: none

    CONTAINER_OVERLAY = /some/other/place/singularity/mnt/overlay

In the case of cluster nodes, you will need to ensure the following
directories are created on all nodes, with ``root:root`` ownership and ``0755`` permissions:

.. code-block:: none

    ${localstatedir}/singularity/mnt

    ${localstatedir}/singularity/mnt/container

    ${localstatedir}/singularity/mnt/final

    ${localstatedir}/singularity/mnt/overlay

    ${localstatedir}/singularity/mnt/session


Singularity will fail to execute without these directories. They are
normally created by the install make target; when using a local
directory for ``--localstatedir`` these will only be created on the node ``make`` is run on.

Building an RPM directly from the source
========================================

Singularity includes all of the necessary bits to properly create an RPM
package directly from the source tree, and you can create an RPM by
doing the following:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ./configure

    $ make dist

    $ rpmbuild -ta singularity-*.tar.gz


Near the bottom of the build output you will see several lines like:

.. code-block:: none

    ...
    Wrote: /home/gmk/rpmbuild/SRPMS/singularity-2.3.el7.centos.src.rpm

    Wrote: /home/gmk/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-2.3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

    Wrote: /home/gmk/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-devel-2.3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

    Wrote: /home/gmk/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-debuginfo-2.3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

    ...

You will want to identify the appropriate path to the binary RPM that
you wish to install, in the above example the package we want to install
is ``singularity-2.3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm`` , and you should install it with the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo yum install /home/gmk/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-2.3.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

.. note:: If you want to have the binary RPM install the files to an
    alternative location, you should define the environment variable
    ‘PREFIX’ (below) to suit your needs, and use the following command to
    build:

.. code-block:: none

    $ PREFIX=/opt/singularity

    $ rpmbuild -ta --define="_prefix $PREFIX" --define "_sysconfdir $PREFIX/etc" --define "_defaultdocdir $PREFIX/share" singularity-*.tar.gz

We recommend you look at our :ref:`security admin guide <security>` to get further information about container
privileges and mounting.
