Admin Quick Start
=================

This quick start gives an overview of installation of Singularity from
source, a description of the architecture of Singularity, and
pointers to configuration files. More information, including alternate
installation options and detailed configuration options can be found
later in this guide.

.. _singularity-architecture:

---------------------------
Architecture of Singularity
---------------------------

Singularity is designed to allow containers to be executed as if they
were native programs or scripts on a host system. No daemon is
required to build or run containers, and the security model is compatible
with shared systems.

As a result, integration with clusters and schedulers such as Univa
Grid Engine, Torque, SLURM, SGE, and many others is as simple as
running any other command. All standard input, output, errors, pipes,
IPC, and other communication pathways used by locally running programs
are synchronized with the applications running locally within the
container.

Singularity favors an 'integration over isolation' approach to
containers. By default only the mount namespace is isolated for
containers, so that they have their own filesystem view. Access to
hardware such as GPUs, high speed networks, and shared filesystems is
easy and does not require special configuration. User home
directories, ``/tmp`` space, and installation specific mounts make it
simple for users to benefit from the reproducibility of containerized
applications without major changs to their existing workflows. Where
more complete isolation is important, Singularity can use additional
Linux namespaces and other security and resource limits to accomplish
this.

.. _singularity-security:

--------------------
Singularity Security
--------------------

Singularity uses a number of strategies to provide safety and
ease-of-use on both single-user and shared systems. Notable security
features include:

 - The user inside a container is the same as the user who ran the
   container. This means access to files and devices from the
   container is easily controlled with standard POSIX permissions.
 - Container filesystems are mounted ``nosuid`` and container
   applications run with the ``PR_NO_NEW_PRIVS`` flag set. This means
   that applications in a container cannot gain additional
   privileges. A regular user cannot ``sudo`` or otherwise gain root
   privilege on the host via a container.
 - The Singularity Image Format (SIF) supports encryption of containers,
   as well as cryptographic signing and verification of their content.
 - SIF containers are immutable and their payload is run directly,
   without extraction to disk. This means that the container can
   always be verified, even at runtime, and encrypted content is not
   exposed on disk.
 - Restrictions can be configured to limit the ownership, location, and
   cryptographic signatures of containers that are permitted to be run.

To support the SIF image format, automated networking setup etc., and
older Linux distributions without user namespace support, Singularity
runs small amounts of privileged container setup code via a
``starter-setuid`` binary. This is a 'setuid root' binary, so that
Singularity can perform filesystem loop mounts and other operations
that need privilege. The setuid flow is the default mode of operation,
but :ref:`can be disabled <install-nonsetuid>` on build, or in the
``singularity.conf`` configuration file if required.

.. note::

   Running Singularity in non-setuid mode requires unprivileged user
   namespace support in the operating system kernel and does not
   support all features, most notably direct mounts of SIF
   images. This impacts integrity/security guarantees of containers at
   runtime.

   See the :ref:`non-setuid installation section <install-nonsetuid>` for further
   detail on how to install singularity to run in non-setuid mode.

------------------------
Installation from Source
------------------------

Singularity Community Edition can be installed from source directly,
or by building an RPM package from the source. Various Linux
distributions also package Singularity, but their packages may not be
up-to-date with the upstream version on GitHub.

To install Singularity directly from source, follow the procedure
below. Other methods are discussed in the :ref:`Installation
<installation>` section.

.. Note::
   
    This quick-start that you will install as ``root`` using
    ``sudo``, so that Singularity uses the default ``setuid``
    workflow, and all features are available. See the :ref:`non-setuid
    installation <install-nonsetuid>` section of this guide for detail
    of how to install as a non-root user, and how this affects the
    functionality of Singularity.

 
Install Dependencies
--------------------

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS install the following dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo yum update -y && \
        sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools' && \
        sudo yum install -y \
        openssl-devel \
        libuuid-devel \
        libseccomp-devel \
        wget \
        squashfs-tools \
        cryptsetup

        
On Ubuntu or Debian install the following dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
        build-essential \
        uuid-dev \
        libgpgme-dev \
        squashfs-tools \
        libseccomp-dev \
        wget \
        pkg-config \
        git \
        cryptsetup-bin

Install Go
----------

Singularity v3 is written primarily in Go, and you will need Go 1.13
or above installed to compile it from source. Versions of Go packaged
by your distribution may not be new enough to build Singularity.

The method below is one of several ways to `install and configure Go
<https://golang.org/doc/install>`_.

.. note::

   If you have previously installed Go from a download, rather than an
   operating system package, you should remove your ``go`` directory,
   e.g. ``rm -r /usr/local/go`` before installing a newer
   version. Extracting a new version of Go over an existing
   installation can lead to errors when building Go programs, as it
   may leave old files, which have been removed or replaced in newer
   versions.


Visit the `Go download page <https://golang.org/dl/>`_ and pick a package
archive to download. Copy the link address and download with wget.  Then extract
the archive to ``/usr/local`` (or use other instructions on go installation
page).

.. code-block:: none

    $ export VERSION=1.14.12 OS=linux ARCH=amd64 && \
        wget https://dl.google.com/go/go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz && \
        sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzvf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz && \
        rm go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz

Then, set up your environment for Go.

.. code-block:: none

    $ echo 'export GOPATH=${HOME}/go' >> ~/.bashrc && \
        echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && \
        source ~/.bashrc


Download Singularity from a GitHub release
------------------------------------------

You can download Singularity from one of the releases. To see a full list, visit
`the GitHub release page <https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/releases>`_.
After deciding on a release to install, you can run the following commands to
proceed with the installation.

.. code-block:: none

    $ export VERSION={InstallationVersion} && # adjust this as necessary \
        wget https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/singularity-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
        tar -xzf singularity-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
        cd singularity


Compile & Install Singularity
-----------------------------

Singularity uses a custom build system called ``makeit``.  ``mconfig`` is called
to generate a ``Makefile`` and then ``make`` is used to compile and install.

.. code-block:: none

    $ ./mconfig && \
        make -C ./builddir && \
        sudo make -C ./builddir install

By default Singularity will be installed in the ``/usr/local`` directory
hierarchy. You can specify a custom directory with the ``--prefix`` option, to
``mconfig``:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ./mconfig --prefix=/opt/singularity

This option can be useful if you want to install multiple versions of
Singularity, install a personal version of Singularity on a shared system, or if
you want to remove Singularity easily after installing it.

For a full list of ``mconfig`` options, run ``mconfig --help``.  Here
are some of the most common options that you may need to use when
building Singularity from source.

- ``--sysconfdir``: Install read-only config files in sysconfdir.
  This option is important if you need the ``singularity.conf`` file
  or other configuration files in a custom location.

- ``--localstatedir``: Set the state directory where containers are
  mounted. This is a particularly important option for administrators
  installing Singularity on a shared file system.  The
  ``--localstatedir`` should be set to a directory that is present on
  each individual node.

- ``-b``: Build Singularity in a given directory. By default this is
  ``./builddir``.

-------------
Configuration
-------------

Singularity is configured using files under ``etc/singularity`` in
your ``--prefix``, or ``--syconfdir`` if you used that option with
``mconfig``. In a default installation from source without a
``--prefix`` set you will find them under
``/usr/local/etc/singularity``.

You can edit these files directly, or using the ``singularity config
global`` command as the root user to manage them.

``singularity.conf`` contains the majority of options controlling the
runtime behaviour of Singularity. Additional files control security,
network, and resource configuration. Head over to the
:ref:`Configuration files <singularity_configfiles>` section where the
files and configuration options are discussed.

----------------
Test Singularity
----------------

You can run a quick test of Singularity using a container in the
Sylabs Container Library:

.. code-block:: none

    $ singularity exec library://alpine cat /etc/alpine-release
    3.9.2


See the `user guide
<\{userdocbaseurl\}/\{userversion\}/>`__ for more
information about how to use Singularity.
